Nat_Agri List
===============

This list contains only AGS values on the state level (Bundesländer) and the national AGS (DG000000). The data was originally published by the Thünen-Institute in the Thünen Report 77 (for the 2018 data files). 

For 2021 we got the data from: "Calculations of gaseous and particulate emissions from German agriculture 1990 - 2021: Input data and emission results"
