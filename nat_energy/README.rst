nat energy data
===============

See sources.csv for information on how we computed the individual columns.

Notice: for AGS 14000000 (Sachsen) the value PV_others had the negative value ``-0.071`` and a value that makes more sense
could not be found in any sources. That's why the artificial value ``0.001`` was used for PV_others (similar to other states).
Due to that the value PV_land_2017 was decreased by ``0,072`` from ``0.386`` to ``0.314`` (because PV_others was increased by ``0,072``).
