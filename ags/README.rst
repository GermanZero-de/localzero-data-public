AGS Master and KE list
===============

The keteamsList.csv list includes all active, currently inactive and befriended KE teams (German: KE - Klimaentscheid) according to https://mitmachen-wiki.germanzero.org/wiki/index.php?title=Klimaentscheide:Klimaentscheid-Teams

The master.csv includes AGS (German: Amtlicher Gemeindeschl√ºssel), a  unique identification number, for states, districts and cities in Germany by the record date 31.12.2018.
The original list for 2018 needs to be requested from destatis, the Federal Statistical office. The list for the current year can be found here: https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Laender-Regionen/Regionales/Gemeindeverzeichnis/_inhalt.html


# 12.03.2022
Unfortunately, the dataset on renewable energy is only valid for 2021 and thus lacks 247 AGS compared to the master.csv from 2018. For now, we solved this issue by removing the respective AGS from the master.csv.
However, we are going to provide the appropriate dataset on renewable energy for the record date 31.12.2018 asap.
