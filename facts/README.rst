Facts Table
===========

This table holds many single facts we used while developing our model. Most of them originate from studies or other soruces.
See more information for each individual fact directly in the table. 

 - label -> *the label we used in our code*
 - group -> *this provides info on how this fact is used in our code*
 	- ud -> *used directly*
 	- ui -> *used indirectly (meaning this fact is not used in the code but used to calculate another one that is ud)*
 	- ufyi -> *for your interest (some facts that are nice to know and might become useful later, when we improve out model)* 
 - description -> *description of the fact*
 - value -> *value of the fact*
 - unit -> *unit of the fact (not available for some facts)*
 - rationale -> *a more detailed description*
 - reference -> *reference*
 - link -> *link to the reference*
