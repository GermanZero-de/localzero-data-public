Assumptions Table
=================

This table holds many single assumptions we assumed and used while developing our model. Most of them originate from studies that provide models of the future of Germany.
See more information for each individual assumption directly in the table. 

 - label -> *the label we used in our code*
 - group -> *this provides info on how this assumption is used in our code*
 	- ud -> *used directly*
 	- ui -> *used indirectly (meaning this assumption is not used in the code but used to calculate another one that is ud)*
 	- ufyi -> *for your interest (some assumptions/facts that are nice to know and might become useful later, when we improve out model)* 
 - description -> *description of the assumption*
 - value -> *value of the assumption*
 - unit -> *unit of the assumption (not available for some assumptions)*
 - rationale -> *a more detailed description*
 - reference -> *reference*
 - link -> *link to the reference*
